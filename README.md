The repository is dedicated to the task assigned to me during my virtual internship at Oasis Infobyte, i.e. The ToDo web app.
I have integrated a calendar, clock and quote of the day to increase this to-do app's productivity and focus feature. I have tried to make it unique, simple and aesthetic all at the same time.
During this tenure of creating a todo app I came up with several ideas and dropped many and in the end, came up with this as my final project. Check out the app here: https://todo-gyanendra.vercel.app/

## Features of the app

- ### Gentle and soothing UI:
            The UI is kept modern, simple and aesthetic, considering that this is a productivity-based website.
            The key elements of UI are the clock, calendar, quote of the day, The todo section and the missed and completed section
- ### ToDo Section:
            - The user can add the tasks he/she wants to focus on.
            - The task created is a list and is accompanied by the complete, edit and delete buttons.
            - Each task marked as completed will be moved to the complete section automatically.
            - Also each missed task using the backend logic will be moved to the missed section
- ### Complete and Missed Section:
            - This section comprised of the tasks that are either marked as completed or missed
            - Each list in each section comes with a delete button.
            - The missed task can be re-assigned to the todo list using the retry button
- ### Clock, Calendar and Quote:
            - These are the elements that not only increase the appealingness and the aesthetics of the website but also motivate the user to complete the task on time
            - The clock gives the ideas on which the user is assigning the task to himself
            - The calendar helps the user to plan his week properly and effectively
            - the quote of the day gives the user the motivation he/she needs to accomplish his/her goals
